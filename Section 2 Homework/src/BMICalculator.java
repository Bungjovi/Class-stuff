/*
	The body mass index (BMI) is commonly used by health and nutrition professionals to estimate 
	human body fat in populations.  You will need to prompt the user for their weight and height. 
	It is computed by taking the individual's weight (mass) in kilograms and dividing it by the 
	square of their height in meters.
	
	Use the 4 categories below to to determine the output.
	
	BMI			Category
	-----------------------------------
	< 18.5			Under Weight
	18.5 - 24.9		Normal
	25.0 - 29.9		Overweight
	30.0 or more		Obese
